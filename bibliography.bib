  abstract = {(1) Background: Globally, millions of tons of food are wasted annually, with a significant portion occurring at the household level. This study aimed to quantify food waste generated by university students and identify key factors associated with this behavior. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a community trial involving 227 Colombian university students. Participants self-reported their daily food waste (grams per person per day), as categorized by food type, which was collected through an online-based questionnaire under prior training. The data were analyzed using a binomial regression model to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios (PRaj) and identify associations between food waste and demographic variables. (3) Results: Of the participants, 63\% were women, with a mean age of 20.4 {\textpm} 3.8 years. Overall, 65\% (n = 148) reported food wastage. The average food waste per person per day was 22.6 {\textpm} 15.5 g, increasing to 94.0 {\textpm} 5.0 g among those who reported wastage. Significant associations were found between food waste and several factors: Among those with a higher prevalence of food waste were women (PRaj = 1.49; 95\% CI: 1.19, 1.89); students from rural areas (PRaj = 1.39; 95\% CI: 1.15, 1.67); and those with higher income levels, with adjusted prevalence ratios of 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.14, 1.68) for those earning 1--2 Minimum Legal Monthly Wages (LMMW) and 1.49 (95\% CI: 1.15, 1.93) for those earning 3+ LMMW. Household size and socioeconomic status were not significantly associated with food waste (p {$>$} 0.05). (4) Conclusions: On average, the population generates 8.25 kg of food waste per person per year, rising to 34.31 kg among those who report wasting food. Gender, geographic location, and income were key predictors of daily food waste.},

  abstract = {, College student food insecurity (FI) is a public health concern. Programming and policies to support students have expanded but utilisation is often limited. The aim of this study was to summarise the barriers to accessing college FI programming guided by the social ecological model (SEM) framework. A scoping review of peer-reviewed literature included an electronic search conducted in MEDLINE, ERIC, and PubMed databases, with a secondary search in Google Scholar. Of the 138 articles identified, 18 articles met eligibility criteria and were included. Articles primarily encompassed organisational (17/18) level barriers, followed by individual (15/18), relationship (15/18), community (9/18), and policy (6/18) levels. Individual barriers included seven themes: Knowledge of Process, Awareness, Limited Time or Schedules, Personal Transportation, Internal Stigma, Perception of Need, and Type of Student. Four relationship barriers were identified: External Stigma, Comparing Need, Limited Availability Causes Negative Perceptions, and Staff. Ten barrier themes comprised the organisational level: Application Process, Operational Process, Location, Hours of Operation, Food Quality, Food Quantity, Food Desirability or Variety of Food, Marketing Materials, Awareness of the Program, and COVID-19 Restrictions. Two barrier themes were identified at the community level, Public Transportation and Awareness of SNAP, while one barrier theme, SNAP Eligibility and Process, encompassed the policy level. Higher education stakeholders should seek to overcome these barriers to the use of food programmes as a means to address the issue of college FI. This review offers recommendations to overcome these barriers at each SEM level.},

This study aims to test an extended theory of planned behaviour that incorporates moral norm, food taste and campus food-saving climate to understand the influence factors of food waste behaviour on campuses.To evaluate the proposed model, an online survey was utilized to collect 513 valid questionnaires.The findings suggest that (1) attitudes towards food waste, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control have a significant influence on intention to reduce food waste; (2) Moral norm and food taste are shown to have a favourable effect on the intention to reduce food waste; (3) Food waste behaviour is significantly determined by intention to reduce food waste; (4) Campus food-saving climate negatively moderates the relationship between intention to reduce food waste and food waste behaviour.This study paves the way to enhance the understanding of the factors of food waste among college students. In addition, this study develops practical strategies to prevent large amounts of food from being wasted on campus.},

abstract = {Information on the scale of food waste, its sources, causes and associated environmental impacts is critical for devising food waste prevention strategies. A number of studies have focused on these issues, but there are still significant knowledge gaps, both in terms of the amount of food waste generated in various parts of the supply chain and the related impacts. In an attempt to address some of these gaps, this study focuses on food waste in the UK to estimate its quantities along the whole supply chains and to assess the resulting life cycle environmental impacts. Furthermore, the contributions of various food groups to food waste and their impacts in different life cycle stages are also quantified. The findings suggest that 13.1 Mt of food waste is generated annually in the UK across all the supply chain, leading to the greenhouse gas emissions of 27 Mt of CO2 eq./yr. The highest volume of waste is generated in the cereals (31%) and vegetables & roots subsectors (28%). However, meat and fish are the major contributors to the total life cycle environmental impacts, even though they account for only 10% of the overall food waste. Although post-consumer waste has the highest contribution, both in terms of waste quantities and environmental impacts, the contribution of other stages (primary production, food processing and distribution) is also significant. These findings emphasise the need to consider environmental impacts of food waste and engage all supply chain actors in formulating food waste reduction strategies.}
